#Define a scoring Mesh, assign a scorer+filter  and save the output in file

#define a boxMesh (cube) with name boxMesh_1

#define number of bins for each axes

#define a scorer via

# 'xxxxx' can be: energyDeposit, doseDeposit, trackLength, cellFlux, cellCharge, passageCellFlux, nOfStep, nOfSecondary, nOfCollision, nOfTrack, nOfTerminatedTrack, ...

#apply a filter to the scorer we are currently creating scorer
