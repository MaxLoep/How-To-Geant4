# How-To-Geant4

V0.2:\
-Started changing the name(s) from 'B1' to 'How-To-Geant4'\
-GeneralParticleSource (GPS) integrated as a way to produce primary particles\
-Some code cleanup\

V0.1 (Initial commit):
-The Geant4 'B1-example' was taken and all kinds of geometries and materials were added to 'B1DetectorConstruction.cc'

Basic Idea:
Geant4 is a powerful simulation toolkit, but hard to get into. I started collecting code-snippets and putting them together because I don't find the Basic-Examples basic enough. You can copy these code-snippets and paste them into any simulation and it 'should' work.
So the basic idea in principle is:
-'You want a Cylinder-geometry in your simulation? here, copy this snippet and change the parameters to fit your needs!'
-'You want a particle source was gaussian distribution and energy E, standard deviation sigma, etc.? Here, copy this snippet and change the parameters!'
-'You want ABC...XYZ? Here, copy this snippet...'
